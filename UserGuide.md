# Knowledge for Zotero User Guide: Workflow

Welcome to **Knowledge for Zotero** !

This note helps you quickly learn how to use this addon in 3 min!

Let's start now.

## 1 What is Knowledge

Knowledge is an extension of Zotero's built-in note function.

Zotero's note is much like a markdown/rich-text editor. You can edit the format with the tools above⬆️.

### 1.1 Workspace Window

The knowledge workspace window contains an outline area(left side⬅️), the main note area, and the preview area(right side➡️).

![workspace](./image/README/workspace.png)

Open workspace by clicking the 'Open Workspace' line above the 'My Library' line in Zotero main window. Alternatively, open it with the '🏠home' button on the top-left of note editors.

### 1.2 Main note

This addon uses a Zotero note item as the main note. It will show up on the main area of the workspace window.

All links will be added to the main note.

Change the main note with the '📂folder' button on the bottom of the outline area(left side⬅️).

Click it, the current note link will be inserted into the main note's cursor position;
