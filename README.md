## Introduction

**Note**: an atomized **note** including a point, or a method described in a paper, or your thoughts while reading the paper, or anything else you drew from a paper.

A note in Zotero looks something like this (below), with quote sentences and your own thoughts.

**Knowledge**: Simply, knowledge = note**s**.
